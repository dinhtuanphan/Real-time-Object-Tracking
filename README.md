## Real-time Object Tracking

Over the years of my research, one of the frequent tasks I had to do was to analyze large amounts of image datasets. The images can be fluorescent/microscopy images or sequences of images from high-speed cameras. Thus, I developed many useful programs, written in MATLAB, for image processing used widely for Quantitative Biology and Real-time Object Tracking.

### Real-time object tracking
This program is used to track the movement of an object inside a microchannel and calculate speed in real-time. The input is real-time videos. Algorithms used in MATLAB are background subtraction, moving average filter, linear regression, and real-time data plotting.

A resulting video to demonstrate is here: [Tracking sweat real-time in a skin wearable sensor](https://www.sites.google.com/view/dinhtuanphan/skills?authuser=0)
